# Simple Decentralized Exchange
A simple decentralised exchange based on a constant product market maker model. Implemented in Solidity, tests with Javascript. 
This is just for educational purposes. Currently, the implementation is rather rudimentary and lacks many features that i.e. Uniswap has.

Built and tested using truffle.
